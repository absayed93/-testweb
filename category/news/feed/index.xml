<p>    Jack Wallen walks through the steps to join new nodes to a Docker swarm as a worker and manager to help manage larger Docker clusters.  Do you have a docker swarm up and running and need to add more nodes to it?  You probably remember how getting started with Docker Swarm introduced you to the join command.  The join token from that command can only be used once, so even if you copy that command to a file, it won&#8217;t work for a new node.  Fortunately, however, Docker developers have made it possible to add new nodes to a swarm at any time.  To do this, you need to have a Docker swarm up and running with at least one controller node and a new node to join.  You can add as many nodes as you need and can do so at any time.  You can join a node as a worker or manager.  The difference is simple: manager nodes elect a leader to manage orchestration tasks, whereas worker nodes receive and execute tasks sent from manager nodes.  Presumably, you&#8217;ll join the node as a worker, but I&#8217;ll show you the commands for both.  First, let&#8217;s join a node as a worker.  Log in to your Docker Swarm controller node and issue the docker swarm join-token worker command.  The output will include the docker swarm join command that you run on the new worker node.  If you want to create a new token, use the rotate option like this: docker swarm join-token &#8211;rotate worker.  Now, if you want to join a node as a manager, the command is docker swarm join-token manager.  To create a new join token, you can use the rotate option in the same way as with the docker swarm join-token &#8211;rotate manager.  Once you run one of those commands on your new node, it will join the swarm as a worker or a manager, and you&#8217;re ready to develop and manage a larger Docker cluster.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term &#8220;childfree&#8221; is used to describe individuals or couples who have made a conscious decision not to have children.  This choice is often influenced by a variety of factors, including personal preference, lifestyle considerations, financial considerations, career aspirations, or concerns about overpopulation or environmental impact.  Last summer, researchers at Michigan State University announced that about 1.7 million adults in Michigan, about one in five, have chosen not to have children, thus living a child-free life.  This figure was remarkably large, surprising many, and was later confirmed by a study  &#8220;We found that 20.9% of Michigan adults do not want children, which closely matches our previous estimate of 21.6%, and that means more than 1.6 million Michiganders are child-free,&#8221; said Jennifer Watling Neal, MSU professor of psychology and co-author of the study. .  &#8220;Michigan is similar to the U.S. as a whole in terms of population, so that could mean 50 million to 60 million Americans are child-free.&#8221;  The new study, published in PLOS ONE, attempted to replicate the original study using the same method, but with a new sample of humans.  The researchers used data from a representative sample of 1,000 adults who completed MSU&#8217;s State of the State survey, administered by the university&#8217;s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.  To avoid any risk of cherry-picking results, the researchers pre-registered the study by recording in advance how the study would be conducted and what they hoped to find.  age, education or income,‚Äù said Zachary Neal, associate professor of psychology at MSU and co-author of the study.  &#8220;However, child-freedom is slightly more common among adults who are male, white or who have always been single.&#8221;  Some worry that child-free adults will regret their decision not to have children, especially later in life.  But Watling Neil explained &#8220;We found no evidence that older child-free adults experienced more life regrets than older parents. In fact, older parents were slightly more likely to want to change something about their lives.&#8221;  &#8220;Because many people are child-free, researchers say this group gets more attention, especially since reproductive rights are being eroded. Reproductive health care can force many people to have children even if they don&#8217;t want to, which is very concerning,&#8221; Neal said. The research team is now examining how abortion restrictions influence adults&#8217; choices to be childfree and is expanding their work beyond Michigan to include other states and countries.

Neal, 5 Apr. 2023, PLOS ONE.DOI: 10.1317 /journal.pone.0283301<br />
