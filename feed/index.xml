Credit: Dickinson Lab, UC San Diego Researchers have used high-tech imaging originally developed for cancer research to gain new insights into important chemicals at work in plant roots.  This groundbreaking research has led to the development of a chemical &#8220;roadmap&#8221; that has significant implications for agricultural productivity, food creation and climate resilience.  When strolling through the park on a sunny spring day, it&#8217;s easy to overlook the unseen complexities beneath.  Terrestrial plant biologists, however, understand that the extensive, finely structured root systems that exist underground are fundamental to plant life and growth.  For example, a tree&#8217;s complex root networks may extend underground just as the tree itself reaches toward the sky  The research team, led by UC San Diego Biological Sciences Postdoctoral Scholar Tao Zhang and Assistant Professor Alexandra Dickinson, used an advanced imaging technique.  Search for corn plant roots.  They developed a &#8220;chemical roadmap&#8221; that details the distribution of important small molecules along plant stem cells and their effects on plant development.  Insights from this study, published in the journal Nature Communications, may provide key insights into how these essential key chemicals affect plant growth.  &#8220;This chemical roadmap provides a resource that scientists can use to find new ways to regulate plant growth,&#8221; said Dickinson, a faculty member in the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology.  &#8220;Having more information about how roots grow can be useful in conservation as we think about protecting our plants in natural environments and making them more sustainable, especially in agriculture.&#8221;  Researchers have used an advanced imaging technology to develop a new understanding of essential key chemicals that are responsible for plant growth.  Credit: Dickinson Lab, UC San Diego While working as a visiting scientist at Stanford University, Dickinson began collaborating with study co-first author Sarah Knoll and Professor Richard Zar, who developed a mass spectrometry imaging system that allows surgeons to distinguish between cancerous and benign tissue. helps to differentiate.  Tumor-removal operation.  Dickinson, Jarre and Knoll adapted the technique—called &#8220;desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging&#8221; or DESI-MSI—to search plant roots for chemicals involved in growth and energy production.  They initially focused on corn plants at the root tip, where stem cells play an active role in plant development.  Their method involves cutting the center of the root to get a clear picture of the chemicals.  &#8220;To help understand plant roots biologically, we need to find out what chemicals are there,&#8221; Jarre said.  “Our imaging system sprays droplets that hit different parts of the root and dissolves the chemical at that location.  A mass spectrometer collects the droplet splash and tells us what those dissolved chemicals are.  By systematically scanning the droplet target spot, we create a spatial map of key chemicals.”  The resulting images, believed to be some of the first to reveal the transition between stem cells and mature root tissue, show the fundamental role metabolic-molecules play in plant energy production.  Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites have become the focus of research as they have been found to be a key player in the regulation of root development.  Coming into the study, the researchers expected a relatively uniform distribution of the chemicals  Instead, with their chemical roadmap in hand, they found that TCA metabolites clustered in patches throughout the root.  &#8220;I was surprised at how many chemicals were characterized in really distinct patterns,&#8221; says Dickinson  &#8220;We can see that the plant is doing this on purpose—it needs these molecules in certain areas to grow properly.&#8221;  The Dickinson lab shows that these TCA metabolites have predictable effects on development, not only in corn, but also in another plant species (Arabidopsis).  This is likely because TCA metabolites are highly conserved – they are produced in all plants as well as animals  Also emerging from the new images were previously unknown chemical compounds  Dickinson says the mystery compounds may be important for plant growth because they also cluster in patterns at specific locations, suggesting a prominent role in development.  Dickinson and his colleagues are now investigating these compounds and comparing maize varieties with different levels of stress resistance to extreme climate conditions and adverse threats such as drought.  The new information will help them develop novel chemical and genetic strategies to improve plant growth and stress resilience.  “We&#8217;re looking at different drought-resistant corn plants to see if we&#8217;ve already found chemicals specific to that variety.  Not seen in other breeds,” said Dickinson.  &#8220;We think this could be a way to find new compounds that can promote growth, especially under harsh conditions.&#8221;  Reference: &#8220;Chemical Imaging Reveals Diverse Functions of Tricarboxylic Acid Metabolism in Root Growth and Development&#8221; Tao Zhang, Sarah E.  Knoll, by Jesus T.  Peng, Amman Claire, Abigail Tripka, Nathan Stutzman, Casey Cheng, Richard N.  Jarre, and Alexandra J.  Dickinson, 4 May 2023, Nature Communications.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA unveiled technology called Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) that allows gamers to naturally talk to non-playable characters (NPCs) and get appropriate responses.  The company revealed the technology during its Generative AI keynote at Computex 2023, showing a demo called Kairos with a playable character talking to an NPC named Jin in a dystopic-looking ramen shop.  The demo (below 32:9, the widest widescreen I&#8217;ve seen) shows the player carrying on a conversation with Jean.  &#8220;Hey Gene, how are you,&#8221; the person asks.  &#8220;Unfortunately, not so good,&#8221; Jean replied.  &#8220;How?&#8221;  &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about crime here. It&#8217;s been bad lately. My ramen shop got caught in the crossfire.&#8221;  Yes, the dialogue is a little wooden;  Looks like ChatGPT might have done a better job.  Still, the idea is that you can just talk into your headset and an NPC will answer in the right context, making for a more natural interaction than you&#8217;d normally get in such a situation.  NVIDIA created the demo in partnership with Convai to promote ACE, which can run both in the cloud and locally (on NVIDIA hardware, natch).  It uses NVIDIA NeMo to create, customize, and deploy large language models that can be customized with lore and character backstories, while using Guardrails to protect against inappropriate dialogue.  It also deploys a speech recognition and speech-to-text tool called Riva with NVIDIA&#8217;s Omniverse Audio2Face &#8220;to instantly create expressive facial animations of a game character to match any speech track.&#8221;  The demo was built in Unreal Engine 5 to show off NVIDIA&#8217;s ray-tracing and other GPU features.  The visuals are actually more compelling than the AI ​​dialogue, though it&#8217;s easy to see how the latter could be vastly improved.  NVIDIA hasn&#8217;t announced any games that will use the technology, but Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl and Fort Solis Omniverse will employ Audio2Face.

      Show more (6 items)<br />
     Bluetooth speakers don&#8217;t only vary in terms of sound but also in shape and size. If you&#8217;re looking for a speaker that&#8217;s truly travel friendly, you&#8217;re going to want one of the top mini Bluetooth speakers. But if you&#8217;re looking for something with big sound that packs some real punch, a larger Bluetooth boom box or party speaker is the way to go.The speakers on this list all have rechargeable batteries and are considered portable speakers, though you may get a workout lugging some of these around. They weigh a minimum of 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms), and some weigh a lot more than that. All feature a built-in strap or handle that makes them easier to lug around. And they all have excellent battery life if you keep the volume at moderate levels, but if you really crank things up, you&#8217;re looking at much-reduced battery life numbers. Most are ready to go for whatever event you have in mind. From camping trips to beach parties, they&#8217;re all fairly rugged. Most offer a good degree of water resistance and a few are fully waterproof and dustproof. I&#8217;ve personally listened to all of these (or, in the case of the Soundcore Trance Go, I&#8217;ve listened to its nearly identical sibling speaker).Read more: Best Bluetooth Wireless Speaker for 2023   David Carnoy/CNET     Anker&#8217;s original Soundcore Motion Boom speaker (see below) has been on this list for a while and is still a decent value at a little more than $100. But the new-for-2022 Motion Boom Plus is significantly improved, particularly in terms of sound quality. It&#8217;s easily one of the best new Bluetooth speakers of 2022. Weighing 5.29 pounds (almost a pound more than the Motion Boom), it uses Bluetooth 5.3 and is equipped with upgraded dual 3.5-inch woofers and newly added dual 1-inch tweeters, delivering up to 80 watts of audio output (60W for the woofers and 20W for the tweeters). Battery life is rated for 20 hours at moderate volume levels. It&#8217;s also IP67 waterproof and dustproof and floats if you happen to drop it in a body of water.I was impressed with the sound quality, which measures up well against a few more expensive &#8212; and some larger &#8212; speakers on this list. You can tweak the sound profile (with EQ settings) and upgrade the speaker&#8217;s firmware in Anker&#8217;s Soundcore companion app for iOS and Android. I tended to go with the bass boost engaged &#8212; there&#8217;s a button on the speaker to activate it &#8212; and found that the speaker delivers full sound with good clarity in the mids and highs and good bass definition. For its size, the speaker is able to put out a lot of sound and mostly manages to avoid distorting at higher volumes (I tended to keep the volume in the 50-75% range). If you&#8217;re sitting within a few feet of the speaker, there&#8217;s a bit of stereo separation. But if you really want to up the sound quality, you can wirelessly pair two Soundcore Motion Boom Plus speakers to create a real stereo pair. Be sure to apply the $20 instant coupon when purchasing with Amazon to get the $160 price.        You&#8217;re receiving price alerts for Anker Soundcore Motion Boom Plus    David Carnoy/CNET     Tribit is known for its affordable smaller Bluetooth speakers that deliver very good sound quality and features for the price. Its new Stormbox Blast speaker is its first Bluetooth boom box speaker, and it delivers mostly impressive sound for its size and also has a built-in light show and USB-out charging. Weighing in at 12 pounds (5.45 kg) with two 30-watt midwoofers and two 15W tweeters, it&#8217;s basically twice as heavy as Anker&#8217;s Motion Boom Plus (see above) and pumps out more volume and bass compared to that speaker, but lacks a bit of clarity. Also, the midrange &#8212; where vocals live &#8212; is a bit recessed at its XBass default setting (I preferred the Music EQ setting in the companion app, which is a bit more balanced). The speaker&#8217;s firmware is upgradeable, and you can pair two Stormbox Blasts to create a stereo pair, which would improve the sound considerably. Battery life is very good. It&#8217;s rated at up 30 hours at moderate volume levels. And the speaker has an IPX7 rating, which means it&#8217;s fully waterproof. Again, like the Soundcore by Anker Motion Boom Plus, the Tribit Stormbox Blast is a good value that measures up well from a sound standpoint against more expensive JBL boom box speakers that arguably offer superior styling. Apply the $20 instant coupon when purchasing with Amazon, to ensure you get the $180 price.        You&#8217;re receiving price alerts for Tribit Stormbox Blast    Screenshot by David Carnoy/CNET     The Soundcore by Anker Rave Party 2 can be stood up vertically or laid down horizontally and features a built-in light show and handle. Like other larger speakers that boast higher power ratings (in this case, 120 watts), this speaker needs to be charged with its own AC adapter rather than a USB-cable and has a USB-A out port on the back for charging your smartphone or any other devices that need some juice. Though it costs more than Tribit&#8217;s Stormbox Blast, the 11.7-pound Rave Party 2 is a more attractively designed speaker and arguably sounds slightly better. Its two 4-inch woofers and two 2-inch tweeters deliver aggressive, punchy sound with enough volume to fill larger rooms (the Tribit&#8217;s bass goes a little deeper, but I was pretty satisfied with this speaker&#8217;s low-end capabilities). For even bigger sound, you can wirelessly link multiple Rave Party 2 and other Soundcore speakers that support the company&#8217;s PartyCast 2.0 feature. While this speaker isn&#8217;t fully waterproof and can&#8217;t float like some speakers can, it&#8217;s splash-proof, with an IPX4 rating, and has a microphone input with discrete gain and reverb controls (no microphone is included). In the companion app for iOS and Android, you can customize the sound profile and light show. Battery life is rated at up to 16 hours, but that number will drop if you crank the volume.I did think the sound held together pretty well at higher volumes &#8212; it mostly avoided distorting &#8212; and the speaker is designed to play loudly outdoors. That said, indoors the speaker sounds best below 75 percent volume, unless you&#8217;re having a party, in which case all critical listening goes out the door.         You&#8217;re receiving price alerts for Soundcore by Anker Rave Party 2    David Carnoy/CNET     JBL&#8217;s third-generation Boombox 3 features some design changes from its predecessor&#8217;s, including a new swankier handle and a new three-way driver system that delivers clearer more detailed sound and similar impressive bass performance, creating bigger, richer sound overall. I could easily hear the difference when comparing this model to the Boombox 2. While the battery life rating remains the same (up to 24 hours at moderate volume levels), this Gen 3 model includes Bluetooth 5.3 instead of Bluetooth 5.1. Also, the speaker weighs about 1.7 pounds more (14.7 pounds or 6.7 kg) and just feels that much more substantial. Like the UE Hyperboom (see below), this has a USB-out port that allows you to charge external devices like your phone, and there&#8217;s also an analog audio input if you want to go wired and connect a device without using Bluetooth connectivity (the Hyperboom adds an optical digital input).For outdoor use, I like the design of the Boombox 3 better than UE Hyperboom. The portable Bluetooth speaker is easier to carry around and just looks more like an outdoor speaker. It&#8217;s also fully waterproof and dustproof with an IPX67 rating (the previous model was waterproof but didn&#8217;t have a dustproof rating).With the JBL Boombox 2, I felt that the speaker, while well-designed, didn&#8217;t quite live up to its expensive price tag from a sound quality standpoint. The Boombox 3 is still pricey, but its sound now has a more premium quality to it &#8212; for portable boomboxes anyway. And if you have really deep pockets, you can link two together to create a stereo pair (or link several together to cover a wider area with sound).         You&#8217;re receiving price alerts for JBL Boombox 3    David Carnoy/CNET     The JBL Partybox Encore Essential is the company&#8217;s smallest PartyBox speaker to date but it&#8217;s still got some heft to it, weighing in at 13 pounds (5.9 kg). It&#8217;s a 11.54 by 10.87 by 12.87-inch cube that has a ring of light over the driver that pulsates and syncs to the beat of your music as it changes colors. The Essential is IPX4 splash-proof and has an integrated handle for easy toting. Rated for 100 watts of power (we always take power ratings with a grain of salt), the speaker doesn&#8217;t have quite the volume or sound quality of the step-up PartyBox 110 (see below). But it has a 5.25-inch woofer and two 1.75-inch tweeters and has plenty of kick to it, and it&#8217;s easier to carry around. In that sense, it offers a nice balance between size and power. Battery life is rated at 6 hours at moderate volume levels, and this speaker charges with an included AC adapter. It also has a charge-out port on the back along with a microphone port if you want to talk or sing to a crowd (microphone not included). To be clear, this is a mono speaker that&#8217;s designed to put out a lot of sound (there&#8217;s a bass boost mode) from a reasonably sized design. You can wirelessly pair two of these speakers and get significantly better sound (in stereo). But that would get a little pricey.        David Carnoy/CNET     Released in 2021, the PartyBox 110 packs some serious punch and delivers bigger sound than some of the portable boombox speakers on this list, including JBL&#8217;s own Boombox 2 (see below). There&#8217;s an integrated handle for toting the speaker, but the PartyBox 110 is pretty hefty, weighing in at 23 pounds and measuring slightly more than 22 inches tall. You can put this bluetooth boom box up vertically as shown in the picture above or place it horizontally, as it has rubber feet on both sides of the speaker.It&#8217;s rated for up to 12 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels and has a redesigned light show that syncs to the beat of your music (you can customize the light show from the speaker itself or use the JBL PartyBox companion app). The speaker has Bluetooth or a wired USB connection and there are guitar and mic inputs. It&#8217;s also worth noting that the speaker is IPX4 splash-proof and you can wirelessly link two PartyBox 110 speakers together for stereo sound. I didn&#8217;t test the stereo mode, but I was impressed with the sound of a single PartyBox 110 &#8212; this bluetooth device puts out lots of well-defined bass with good overall clarity in the highs and mids &#8212; and I suspect that pairing two of these together would be pretty awesome. I also liked how the speaker has no external AC adapter brick and only requires a cord for charging (the power adapter is in the speaker). For longer parties during which you&#8217;re really cranking the tunes, you&#8217;d want to plug the speaker in if possible. But it does deliver enough volume to fill a spacious living room with sound and also plays loud enough for a small pool or beach party. The PartyBox 710 ($800) is a massive party speaker that has integrated wheels and requires a power source to operate; it does not have an integrated rechargeable battery. This is your best bet if you want a portable speaker that can deliver big, quality sound and operates on battery power. To be clear, this offers bigger and better sound than the JBL Boombox 2 &#8212; but it is harder to carry around.       David Carnoy/CNET     Anker&#8217;s Soundcore Motion Boom is what I&#8217;d call a mini portable boombox speaker. It&#8217;s kind of a poor man&#8217;s version of JBL&#8217;s well-regarded Xtreme 3 speaker, which lists for $350. Equipped with a handle and weighing a little over 4 pounds, the speaker reminds me of one of those giant flashlights or &#8220;floating lanterns&#8221; that were in vogue about 30 years ago. For the record, the Motion Boom actually does float and it&#8217;s got an IPX7   waterproof rating. Anker says the Motion Boom delivers &#8220;huge stereo sound&#8221; and, yes, this portable bluetooth speaker plays pretty loud and has a decent amount of bass with reasonable clarity &#8212; but I wouldn&#8217;t call it huge and there&#8217;s not much stereo separation (I kept the bass boost on at all times because the speaker sounds better that way.) It can&#8217;t compete against bigger and more expensive speakers like JBL&#8217;s Boombox 2 ($500) and Ultimate Ears&#8217; Hyperboom ($400), but it packs a lot more volume and punch than more compact Bluetooth speakers like JBL&#8217;s Flip 5 that cost around the same. It also travels well, so it&#8217;s ideal for a beach excursion or a little tailgating. It also can be used as a backup battery to charge your smartphone or other mobile device.The newer Motion Boom Plus (see above) does offer a significant bump in sound quality for about $65 to $75 more, depending on pricing fluctuations. If you can afford it, the Motion Boom Plus is the better option. If you want to go smaller, the Anker Soundcore Motion Plus Bluetooth speaker delivers very good sound for its size. It&#8217;s not a Bluetooth boombox, however, and doesn&#8217;t feature an integrated handle like the Motion Boom and Motion Boom Plus.        You&#8217;re receiving price alerts for Anker Soundcore Motion Boom    David Carnoy/CNET     Sony&#8217;s SRS-XG500 is the most direct competitor to the JBL Boombox 2. They&#8217;re similarly priced and sized, with both featuring an integrated handle. The Sony is a little larger but weighs slightly less at 12.34 pounds (5.6 kg). I went back and forth comparing the sound of the two speakers. While I liked the JBL&#8217;s sound a bit more because it came across as sounding a little clearer with better detail, the Sony pumps out a lot of bass &#8212; it has a warmer, boomier sound quality that some people may prefer.It&#8217;s IP66 water-resistant and dustproof, meaning it can take a sustained spray of water but it can&#8217;t be fully submerged. You also get a mic/guitar rear input and dual USB-out ports for charging your devices. (The speaker has its own power adapter; you can&#8217;t charge it via USB-C.) Battery life is rated at 30 hours at moderate volume levels, which is very good. Crank your tunes and that number drops substantially. At night, you can light up the speaker with the LED light strips that ring the inside of the bass ports and use the Fiestable app to control the LEDs. The Sony Music app allows you to tweak the sound profile. Additionally, you can link the speaker with other Sony Bluetooth speakers to augment the sound.         Watch this: JBL Boombox 2 vs. UE Hyperboom: Battle of the portable Bluetooth beasts<br />
          04:13     David Carnoy/CNET     The UE Hyperboom has a few things going for it over the Boombox 2. For starters, the price: It&#8217;s $450 while the Boombox 2 is $500. And right now you can get $22 off, when you apply the coupon on Amazon.For outdoor use, I give the nod to the JBL&#8217;s design. Both of these weigh 13 pounds, but the JBL is a little more natural to carry around. It&#8217;s got the handle, the tubular design &#8212; it looks like it belongs outdoors. The Hyperboom&#8217;s got a thick rubber strap and it kind of feels like you&#8217;re carrying a big pitcher of something really solid. It&#8217;s boxy and understated, and it looks a little more at home indoors.The Hyperboom is splashproof with an IPX4 rating while the Boombox 2 is fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. (I put them out in the rain and they both survived without issues.) Like the Boombox 2, this has a USB-out port that allows you to charge devices like your phone and it also has analog audio input if you want to go wired and connect a device without using Bluetooth. However, the Hyperboom adds an optical digital input. That means you can connect it to a TV, PC or game console with an optical output. You can also toggle between two Bluetooth connections and it has a built-in microphone that calibrates the speaker&#8217;s sound to wherever it is, inside or outside.The Hyperboom also is the better-sounding portable Bluetooth speaker overall. It has a wider soundstage with slightly more bass and clarity. It also sounds a little more natural. If you can afford it, you can link up two Hyperbooms and create a stereo pair. You can also link it wirelessly to the latest UE Bluetooth speakers to spread out the sound across a wider area. Read our Ultimate Ears Hyperboom review.<br />
            Amazon     Last year I reviewed Anker&#8217;s Soundcore Rave Neo party speaker and gave it high marks. The Trance Go is essentially that speaker without the integrated LEDs that allow you to create a mini light show. It costs right around $100, plays loud for its size (it&#8217;s a medium-size speaker that weighs about 6 pounds) and has a built-in handle that makes it easy to tote around. The speaker is fully waterproof and can get up to 24 hours on a single charge at moderate levels. A USB port allows you to charge devices. Also worth noting: For those who want more expansive sound for streaming music, you can link multiple Trance Go speakers.        David Carnoy/CNET     If you don&#8217;t want to get something quite as big as the JBL Boombox 2, the Xtreme 3 weighs a good deal less but is still large by Bluetooth speaker standards and puts out a lot of sound (though not as much as the Boombox 2). Instead of a built-in handle, a detachable shoulder strap is included.Like JBL&#8217;s smaller Bluetooth speakers, the Xtreme 3 is a versatile boom box that can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally. Though a tad bigger than the Xtreme 2, at first glance it doesn&#8217;t look much different from the previous model, but it does have upgraded sound with slightly better bass and clarity while actually weighing slightly less. Here are the key differences between the two speakers, according to JBL: Plays slightly louder: The Xtreme 3&#8217;s rated output power is 2 x 25W versus the Xtreme 2&#8217;s 2 x 20W.The Xtreme 3 is IPX67 (waterproof/dustproof) versus the Xtreme 2&#8217;s IPX7 (waterproof).The Xtreme 3 offers JBL PartyBoost while the Xtreme 2 has JBL Connected Plus syncing technologies.The Xtreme 3 improves charge time to just 2.5 hours, down from 3.5 hours for the Xtreme 2 (both have 15 hours of battery life)The Xtreme 3 has Bluetooth 5.1, the Xtreme 2 has Bluetooth 4.2 .The Xtreme 3 is slightly larger but at 4.3 pounds weighs less than the Xtreme 2, which is 5.3 pounds.

<p>    Jack Wallen walks through the steps to join new nodes to a Docker swarm as a worker and manager to help manage larger Docker clusters.  Do you have a docker swarm up and running and need to add more nodes to it?  You probably remember how getting started with Docker Swarm introduced you to the join command.  The join token from that command can only be used once, so even if you copy that command to a file, it won&#8217;t work for a new node.  Fortunately, however, Docker developers have made it possible to add new nodes to a swarm at any time.  To do this, you need to have a Docker swarm up and running with at least one controller node and a new node to join.  You can add as many nodes as you need and can do so at any time.  You can join a node as a worker or manager.  The difference is simple: manager nodes elect a leader to manage orchestration tasks, whereas worker nodes receive and execute tasks sent from manager nodes.  Presumably, you&#8217;ll join the node as a worker, but I&#8217;ll show you the commands for both.  First, let&#8217;s join a node as a worker.  Log in to your Docker Swarm controller node and issue the docker swarm join-token worker command.  The output will include the docker swarm join command that you run on the new worker node.  If you want to create a new token, use the rotate option like this: docker swarm join-token &#8211;rotate worker.  Now, if you want to join a node as a manager, the command is docker swarm join-token manager.  To create a new join token, you can use the rotate option in the same way as with the docker swarm join-token &#8211;rotate manager.  Once you run one of those commands on your new node, it will join the swarm as a worker or a manager, and you&#8217;re ready to develop and manage a larger Docker cluster.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gert-Jan Oskam was living in China in 2011 when he was in a motorcycle accident that left him paralyzed from the hips down.  Now, with a combination of devices, scientists have given him back control over his lower body.  &#8220;For 12 years I&#8217;ve been trying to get my legs back,&#8221; Mr Oskam said at a press briefing on Tuesday.  &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve learned how to walk naturally, naturally.&#8221;  In a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, researchers in Switzerland described implants that provided a &#8220;digital bridge&#8221; between Mr. Oskam&#8217;s brain and his spinal cord, bypassing the injured parts.  The invention allows Mr Oskam, 40, to stand, walk and climb a steep ramp with only the aid of a walker.  More than a year after the implant was inserted, he retained these abilities and actually showed signs of neurological recovery, walking with crutches even after the implant was removed.  Grégoire Courtaine, a spinal cord specialist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, who led the study, said at a press briefing.  Neuroscientist Jocelyn Bloch.  &#8220;It was quite science fiction for me at the beginning, but today it has become reality,&#8221; added Mr Oskam, who implanted Mr Oskam at the University of Lausanne.  In recent years there have been several advances in technological spinal cord injury treatment.  In 2016, a group of scientists led by Dr. Courtin managed to restore the ability to walk in paralyzed monkeys and helped another man regain control of his paralyzed arm.  In 2018, a different team of scientists, led by Dr Courtin, developed a way to stimulate the brain with electrical-pulse generators, allowing partially paralyzed people to walk and cycle again.  Last year, more advanced brain stimulation methods allowed paralyzed people to swim, walk and cycle within a day of treatment.  Mr.  Oskam underwent stimulation procedures in earlier years, and even regained the ability to walk, but eventually his progress plateaued.  At the press briefing, Mr. Oskam said that these stimulation technologies made him feel that there was something alien about locomotion, an alien distance between his mind and body.  The new interface changed that, he said: “Earlier the stimulus was controlling.  I am, and now I am controlling the impulse.”  In the new study, the brain-spinal interface, as the researchers call it, took advantage of an artificial intelligence thought decoder to read Mr. Oskam&#8217;s intentions — detectable as his electrical signals.  brain &#8211; and their muscle movements to match.  The etiology of natural movement, from thought to intention, was preserved.  The only addition, as Dr.  Courtaine describes the digital bridge spanning the injured parts of the spine.  Andrew Jackson, a neuroscientist at Newcastle University who was not involved in the research, said: &#8220;It raises interesting questions about autonomy, and the source of order. You keep blurring the philosophical boundaries between what the brain is and what technology is.&#8221;  Dr. Jackson added that scientists in the field have theorized about connecting the brain to spinal cord stimuli for decades, but this represents the first time they&#8217;ve achieved such success in a human patient. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to say, it&#8217;s much harder to do.&#8221; ,&#8221; he said. To achieve these results, the researchers first implanted electrodes on Mr. Oskam&#8217;s skull and spine. The team then used a machine-learning program to observe which parts of the brain lit up as he tried to move different parts of his body. This thought decoder is specific. were able to match the activity of specific electrodes to the target: one configuration lit up whenever Mr. Oskam tried to move his ankle, another when he tried to move his hip. The researchers then used another algorithm to connect the brain implant to the spinal implant, which was in his body. Different parts were set to send electrical signals, sparking movement. The algorithm was able to account for slight changes in the direction and speed of each muscle contraction and relaxation.  And, because the signals between the brain and spinal cord were sent every 300 milliseconds, Mr. Oskam could quickly adjust his technique based on what was working and what wasn&#8217;t.  He can twist his hip muscles within the first treatment session  Over the next few months, researchers fine-tuned the brain-spinal interface to better accommodate basic actions like walking and standing.  Mr. Oskam regained a somewhat healthy range of motion and was able to navigate steps and ramps with relative ease without treatment for several months.  Furthermore, after a year of treatment, he began to notice a clear improvement in his movement without the aid of a brain-spinal interface.  Researchers documented these improvements in weight bearing, balance and walking tests  Now, Mr Oskam can walk limited distances around his home, get in and out of cars and stop at a bar for a drink.  For the first time, she said, she felt like she was in control  The researchers acknowledge the limitations of their work  It is difficult to distinguish subtle motives in the brain, and although the current brain-spine interface is suitable for walking, the same probably cannot be said for restoring upper body movement.  Treatment is also invasive, requiring multiple surgeries and hours of physical therapy.  The current system does not correct all spinal cord paralysis  But the team is hopeful that further advances will make the treatment more accessible and more systemically effective  &#8220;That&#8217;s our real objective,&#8221; said Dr. Courtaine, &#8220;to make this technology available around the world to all patients who need it.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
				This week, WorldCoin, an outfit that aims to serve as proof of personality in a world where it&#8217;s increasingly difficult to distinguish a human from a bot, raised $115 million in Series C funding.  Led by 10-year-old venture firm Blockchain Capital, whose bets include Coinbase, Kraken and OpenC, the investment brings WorldCoin&#8217;s funding to at least $240 million, even as the controversial company — founded in 2019 by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman — has a lot to prove.  Yesterday, we spoke with Blockchain Capital General Partner Spencer Bogart about what gave him confidence in WorldCoin, which aims to create a global ID, a global currency and an app that enables payments, purchases and transfers.  Like many others, we wondered how it could achieve its goals when, at least for now, its mission rests first and foremost on convincing billions of people to allow WorldCoin to scan their irises using a futuristic, technology-dense globe.  Below is part of that conversation, edited for length.  You can also listen to longer conversations here.  Your co-investors in this new round include previous backers Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global.  Have Khosla Ventures or Tiger Global, the previous backers, re-engaged?  They can be part of this financing;  I don&#8217;t believe they are a big part of it.  How many companies do investors own?  I guess it&#8217;s difficult to negotiate with Sam Altman because of the power he has and his extensive experience on the other side of the table as an investor.  This is an accurate characterization.  Sam is a strong founder and knows how to run a cap table.  Again, I apologize.  It is not a statistic in front of me right now.  Generally, companies sell 20% [equity] In every financing.  Well, things can go significantly down or up from there.  I think in this case, the number is going to be meaningfully lower than Series A, Series B and Series C.  How long have you been talking to WorldCoin and what inspired you to lead this deal?  Sam wondered if the real genesis was: What if I could create a cryptocurrency that I could distribute to everyone in the world and everyone gets an equal share of it?  For me, from an entrepreneurial perspective, it&#8217;s definitely interesting [though] I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s something that we would be very excited to go and underwrite based on the things that our team is generally interested in.<br />
[Meanwhile] This essentially requires ensuring that no one person accumulates a disproportionate share of it, which requires people to be able to identify unique people.  And this really gets into the part that we&#8217;re excited about, which is the world ID.  It is this ability to easily distinguish between machines and humans on the Internet [because] Most of the Internet is supported by advertising revenue and it costs just as much to serve bot traffic as it does to serve human traffic.  This is why various applications and service providers have used captcha to differentiate between bots and humans.  But in the world of advanced automated systems and especially things powered by AI, this is no longer the case.  It doesn&#8217;t even distinguish between unique humans, so I don&#8217;t know if the same person is coming to receive an additional asset, which leads us to: OK, how can we provide a way to distinguish between humans and bots and ensure that every human Unique?  Which leads to biometrics.  Biometrics are at the core of what defines humans, and my first thought was: Why build this custom hardware to scan the eyeball?  As such, billions of people are already walking around with an iPhone.  Why don&#8217;t we use Face ID, right?  The problem is that human facial structures do not have enough randomness, or entropy, to differentiate between unique people, at the scale of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people.  I didn&#8217;t realize that was the case.  This is not something that has happened to me either.  I didn&#8217;t think about the fact that once you get past a hundred million people, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of people who look like Spencer Bogart;  Their facial structure is not sufficiently distinguishable from mine.  Fingerprints have the same problem;  Fingerprints do not have enough randomness.  This leads us to two viable options, DNA that has enough randomness to be able to prove human uniqueness on the scale of billions of people.  But you are providing too much information with DNA.  Then there are irises.  It turns out that the human iris has an insane amount of entropy and randomness.  And in this case, the team has built an insane amount of protection.  You get an iris scan, it doesn&#8217;t save your iris by default.  It is immediately deleted on the device.  It is only used to generate an iris code, which is a unique mapping or encoding of your iris.  And it is compared with all others.  And now, with these iris codes, we don&#8217;t know their names or locations or anything.  All we know about them all is that they are unique people.  I guess an enterprise strategy — helping companies minimize their interactions with bots — is the most lucrative opportunity for WorldCoin right now.  You can also deliver this cryptocurrency to everyone, although it&#8217;s not clear to me how people will use it.  But before any of that can happen, you need to get a meaningful number of people in front of these orbs that are weird and not easily accessible, when people are already worried about biometrics and cryptocurrency.  WorldCoin says it has now scanned 2 million people&#8217;s eyes.  How many are needed for this to be meaningful?  Ten million?  This is the right question.  About it: Do you have a network of proven unique people?  And it&#8217;s only going to be interesting for applications and enterprises at a certain scale.  But I think it will depend on the use case.  By the time you get to 10 million unique users, there are already a lot of applications that want to use it, others won&#8217;t be interested in using it unless you&#8217;re on a network of 500 million or a billion or 2.  Billions of people.  Some of the other challenges here are yes, obviously, room distribution.  Currently there are 200 to 300 [orbs] In the wild today, with more than 2,000 that have been produced and are waiting to be deployed.  Then there is this question of public perception.  Something we flagged as part of the investment is: Is there going to be such a negative perception of it that no matter how confident we are that it&#8217;s 100% sustainable, is the public perception going to be so negative that people won&#8217;t want to participate?  So far, the data says otherwise.  WorldCoin has already onboarded nearly 2 million people by operating a pretty capital-intensive boots-on-the-ground strategy, and it&#8217;s only in beta testing.  This is without pushing or pulling any levers of marketing;  This protocol is even without mainnet live.  This is only in preliminary testing.  As for some of the things it could be used for, Elon Musk talked a lot about a bot problem on Twitter, and if we could pay everyone $8 a month, it would help solve the bot problem.  We think that World ID is a low-friction way of solving the same problem and will be a high-fidelity solution.  And there are many new applications and services that historically did not exist because of our inability to make this distinction  What they are, I don&#8217;t know, but we are interested in financing them.  Again, you can hear more about the investment here, including why OpenAI itself could one day become a major customer of Worldcoin, why Bogart wasn&#8217;t bothered when hackers recently installed password-stealing malware on the devices of multiple Worldcoin orb operators, and why he flash trades on the blockchain.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term &#8220;childfree&#8221; is used to describe individuals or couples who have made a conscious decision not to have children.  This choice is often influenced by a variety of factors, including personal preference, lifestyle considerations, financial considerations, career aspirations, or concerns about overpopulation or environmental impact.  Last summer, researchers at Michigan State University announced that about 1.7 million adults in Michigan, about one in five, have chosen not to have children, thus living a child-free life.  This figure was remarkably large, surprising many, and was later confirmed by a study  &#8220;We found that 20.9% of Michigan adults do not want children, which closely matches our previous estimate of 21.6%, and that means more than 1.6 million Michiganders are child-free,&#8221; said Jennifer Watling Neal, MSU professor of psychology and co-author of the study. .  &#8220;Michigan is similar to the U.S. as a whole in terms of population, so that could mean 50 million to 60 million Americans are child-free.&#8221;  The new study, published in PLOS ONE, attempted to replicate the original study using the same method, but with a new sample of humans.  The researchers used data from a representative sample of 1,000 adults who completed MSU&#8217;s State of the State survey, administered by the university&#8217;s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.  To avoid any risk of cherry-picking results, the researchers pre-registered the study by recording in advance how the study would be conducted and what they hoped to find.  age, education or income,” said Zachary Neal, associate professor of psychology at MSU and co-author of the study.  &#8220;However, child-freedom is slightly more common among adults who are male, white or who have always been single.&#8221;  Some worry that child-free adults will regret their decision not to have children, especially later in life.  But Watling Neil explained &#8220;We found no evidence that older child-free adults experienced more life regrets than older parents. In fact, older parents were slightly more likely to want to change something about their lives.&#8221;  &#8220;Because many people are child-free, researchers say this group gets more attention, especially since reproductive rights are being eroded. Reproductive health care can force many people to have children even if they don&#8217;t want to, which is very concerning,&#8221; Neal said. The research team is now examining how abortion restrictions influence adults&#8217; choices to be childfree and is expanding their work beyond Michigan to include other states and countries.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone who&#8217;s lost track of three hours staring at their computer may be familiar with the feeling of eyeballs plastered to the screen.  As it turns out, staring at our phones, tablets and laptops for many hours a day is not good for our eyes.  This can cause symptoms of digital eye strain, which stems from the hard work our eyes have to do when navigating a screen.  According to the American Optometric Association, using phones, computers and other devices requires specific, but particularly demanding, &#8220;skills.&#8221;  Coordinating movement of our eyes, including eye movements, from one position to another;  accommodation, the ability to switch focus from one distance to another;  and vergence, focusing the eyes toward the nose and away from the nose depending on distance. &#8220;Our eyes are not designed to use computers and digital devices, especially for long periods of time,&#8221; says Dr. Robert C.  &#8220;As a result, many people who read or work on screens for long periods of time experience eye discomfort and vision problems,&#8221; Layman, a past president of the AOA, said in an email.  With the world we live in and all the great things at our fingertips, cutting screen time entirely is probably not realistic (although it can be done).  So here&#8217;s what to know about what plasters on a screen can do to your eyes and how to remove them safely.  Eye Strain and Blue Light: What Too Much &#8216;Screening&#8217; Does to Your Eyes  There has been a lot of debate about blue light  , which we get in large amounts from the sun and in small amounts from our screens.  Exposure to blue light signals to our body that it&#8217;s time to feel awake, which is one reason why using your phone before bed can be one of the biggest sleep disruptors, as it messes with our sleep-wake cycle.  While research shows that exposure to blue light from the sun over time can increase the risk of diseases that cause vision loss, including macular degeneration and cataracts, light from our electronics has yet to be shown to carry this risk.  devices according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.  Compared to the typical 1 microwatt of light coming through our screens, AMDF says, available research shows 3 microwatts or more of retinal cell damage.  Dr. Matt Starr, a clinical spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said in an email that blue light by itself &#8220;does not cause permanent eye damage.&#8221;  Lehmann, however, said that overexposure to blue light can cause digital eye strain, which can lead to age-related vision problems in some patients.  Blue light effects aside, eye strain is a common and uncomfortable problem.  Although it can be experienced &#8220;somewhat differently from person to person,&#8221; according to Starr, it&#8217;s a group of symptoms that come from staring at a screen for long periods of time.  &#8220;Common symptoms include blurred vision, out-of-body sensation, itching, headache and dry eyes,&#8221; he said.  Interestingly, Layman says that screen time can lead to a higher risk of infection in some cases, because we blink less when looking at a screen.  &#8220;Blinking helps create and spread tears across the cornea, which keeps your eye hydrated,&#8221; Layman said.  &#8220;When the eyes don&#8217;t have enough tears to wash away the foreign material, they become prone to infection.&#8221;  We need more research on the effects of blue light from electronic screens.  But looking at your phone every night before bed is bad for your health anyway, because it disrupts your wake-wake cycle.  Cavan Images/Getty Images So do blue light glasses really work?  There really is still a proven medical benefit.  But there&#8217;s no harm in seeing if they help you.&#8221; Although some patients report the benefits of using blue light glasses while using computers, smartphones, and tablets to prevent eye strain, the reality is, there&#8217;s not enough science to support or disprove them. No. Benefit at this point,&#8221; Lehman said.  Personally, I occasionally use a pair of blue light glasses when I feel extra eye strain or I find myself needing extra focus, and I generally find it a bit easier to focus on my computer screen.  But I have no idea if it&#8217;s actually helping my eyes feel less strained, or if it&#8217;s just a placebo effect that helps me slightly change my perspective.  Starr confirms it&#8217;s likely the latter by pointing to this study from the American Journal of Ophthalmology, which found no difference between people wearing placebo glasses and blue light glasses.  But since blue light glasses are so cheap (I bought mine for under $15 online a few years ago) if you spend hours in front of a computer, they&#8217;re worth a test run to see if they help you at all.  Prices start around $9 at places like Walmart or Amazon, or you can read our review of the best blue light glasses.  Is using &#8216;dark mode&#8217; good for your eyes?  The biggest cheer from the audience at this year&#8217;s Google I/O event came when the tech company announced Bird, Google&#8217;s AI chatbot, was getting a dark mode.  But is it really something to celebrate, in terms of eye health?  This may depend on the brightness of the screen in the room you&#8217;re using it, according to Layman.  He said that &#8220;dark mode&#8221; can be good in a dimly lit, but not completely dark, room, and that light mode (black text on a white page, aka &#8220;positive polarity&#8221;) is better in a room with normal lighting.  Layman points to this study from 2013, which shows that positive polarity allows people to see details better.  Starr adds that using a dark mode, or turning on &#8220;night mode&#8221; on your phone, has some benefits in how easily our eyes are able to adjust.  &#8220;The contrast and colors used in night mode reduce glare and help our eyes adjust more easily to the surrounding light, resulting in less eye strain and easier, more comfortable reading,&#8221; he said.  As with blue light glasses, you should try playing with dark mode to see if it helps your eyes at all or makes them feel less strained.  Can Screen Time Make Bad Vision Worse?  When I went to the ophthalmologist last month for an eye exam, I asked my doctor this question and he said the research isn&#8217;t there to give a one-way causal answer.  There can be a chicken-or-egg scenario at play.  For example, people who are nearsighted may sit closer to their screens and potentially expose themselves to more eye strain or blue light, but this may not actively cause a poor prescription, but rather based on the fact that they can&#8217;t see well.  Have their faces scooch close to the screen.  Starr had a similar explanation: &#8220;There is some research that suggests close work activities, such as reading or using a screen for hours at a time, can lead to increased nearsightedness, especially in children whose eyes are still growing,&#8221; he said.  .According to the AAO&#8217;s data on vision development, studies have shown that children who spend an extra 40 minutes outside per day have a lower risk of developing myopia or severe myopia (very strong prescription), compared to children who spend more time indoors.  , either using computer devices or reading.  The AAO adds that there&#8217;s no direct link, but kids spending more time outdoors (and less screen time) are better for their health.  Also Read: Is Your Vision Worsening?  It&#8217;s time for eye exam tips to protect your eyes from technology Whether staring at a screen all day can permanently damage your eyesight, there are some simple steps you can take to make them feel more comfortable.  Keep your phone &#8220;reading distance&#8221; from your face.  This tip comes from the layman, who says it will reduce the focussing demands on your eyes  Make your font bigger  Another tip from the layman, upgrading your font size can make for a more comfortable viewing experience.  Follow the 20/20/20 rule.  Starr and Layman recommend that every 20 minutes, you take a 20-second break from your screen by looking 20 feet away.  &#8220;Blink, close your eyes, and look 20 feet away during the pause,&#8221; says Starr.  When possible, use a pen and paper.  (Even if you think it&#8217;s ridiculous.) This tip isn&#8217;t backed by science, but it&#8217;s helpful for me (I&#8217;m very nearsighted and work in front of a computer all day).  I use a physical notebook for a calendar because it&#8217;s a little relief for my eyes, which are usually glued to my laptop.  I use pen and paper to write something for fun and to take notes.  Limit screens to an hour or two before bed (and whenever you can).  This sleeping regimen is a tip from Starr.  Not only will limiting screen time before bed help your eyes, it can also help you feel less stressed and disengage from the day&#8217;s responsibilities.  Learn more about how to reduce phone time.  Both General and Starr emphasize the importance of eye exams, usually recommended at least every two years, but more often if you wear glasses or contacts, or if you experience discomfort or pain in the eye area.  Your eye doctor or ophthalmologist will be able to prescribe medicated drops or look for other causes of eye discomfort besides screen time, if you need it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TikTok may soon get a new way for users to discover content.  The company is in the &#8220;early stages&#8221; of testing an AI-powered chatbot called Taco, which will be able to recommend videos and answer questions about what users are watching.  The bot, which was first reported by TechCrunch, is currently being tested in the Philippines, TikTok said in a statement.  &#8220;Tako is powered by a third-party chat assistant and designed to help make it easier to discover entertaining and inspiring content on TikTok,&#8221; the company said.  Despite being in the early stages of testing, TikTok is apparently featuring tacos fairly prominently in the app.  A shortcut for Assistant sits in the right-hand menu alongside a shortcut to bookmarks, according to TechCrunch, which took a peek at the feature.  This is similar to the prominence Snap has given to its chatbot My AI in its app, pushing it to the top of user chats.  But unlike My AI, TikTok seems to be positioning Tako as a way to discover new content and learn more about what&#8217;s being discussed in clips.  Users should &#8220;feel free to ask me anything and I&#8217;ll do my best to help you find what you&#8217;re looking for,&#8221; the bot says in a screenshot of the chat interface.  Tako isn&#8217;t the only way TikTok is experimenting with generative AI.  The company is also testing AI-generated avatars, but has not announced plans for a wider rollout.  But it&#8217;s not clear for now how serious TikTok is about the technology.  In its statement, the company said Taco &#8220;has no current plans for this beyond these initial tests&#8221;.</p>
